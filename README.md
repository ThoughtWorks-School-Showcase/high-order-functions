# JavaScript High-Order Functions

## Business Requirement:
Refactor codebase with JS high-order functions and eliminate all `for` statements.

## Practice Challenges:
* Map an array to another array which has the length
* Caculate a value with array via reduce method
* Find the specific element in an array
* Filter an array
* Determine whether a specific element is included in the array

## Practice Requirement:
* Pass all tests
* Eliminate all `for` statements
* Commit frequently with readable comment via Git
* Coding with keyboard shortcuts

## Practice Output:
You can find the requirement detail in the test code comments under `spec\section-n` directory. And you should put your code in the directory `main`.
For example, the production code of `spec/section-1/practice-1-spec.js` should be put into `main/section-1/practice-1.js`.

## Environment
JavaScript ES6。

## How to begin：
Open your terminal, change to any path and clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/tws-online-quiz/high-order-functions
```
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Run all tests:
```
npm test
```
Run specific test:
```
node_modules/jasmine/bin/jasmine.js spec/section-1/practice-1-spec.js
```
You can find these two key folders when you open the repository with your favorite coding editor:
```
spec  //Test code, stands for specifications
src   //Source code
```
